# Good news everyone!

SO! Last night was a moderate success. I have managed to partition my Steam Deck SSD to support dual-booting SteamOS AND Windows. That's pretty sweet. Now I can hop into Windows to play games from other launchers when I'd like to (Fortnite anyone?). Overall the process was pretty smooth (besides some finagling with the KDE Partition Manager).

In other news, I've brought my homelab back online. This means that my CDC Wonder COD dashboard is now live again and can be viewed [here](https://shiny.strbckr.com/demos/cdc-wonder-cod). Check it out if you'd like! Cloudflare tunnels make it pretty easy to host container services -- for more information you can check out the architecture diagram in my [2023-12-04](https://strbckr.github.io/2023/12/04/asimov@home.html) post. 

Now all that remains is to transition my domain from the Github Pages site over to strbckr.com. Should be able to do that in a couple hours. (EDIT: Done! And served over HTTPS to boot)

Hope you are doing well and have a great day!
