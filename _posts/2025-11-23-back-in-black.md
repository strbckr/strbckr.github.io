# Back in black

Hello world! We have returned to the internet with a brand new website (on account of me getting locked out of my old github -- oh well!)

It's been a while, and much of my time has been spent getting services back up and running to support this portfolio site and blog. We're 90% of the way there! The last thing for me to do is get my homelab back up so I can deliver R Shiny dashboards again. But before I do that, I'm thinking about switching my mini PC over to an Ubuntu distribution (since previously I was running containers through WSL). We'll likely take care of that next weekend.

In the meantime, tonight I'm going to take a crack at installing Windows onto my Steam Deck so I can dual-boot and get into Fortnite. Wish me luck, and hope you are well.
